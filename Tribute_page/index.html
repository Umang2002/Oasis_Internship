                        I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back, in somewhat like a
                        normal version of the planet has been restored, if there ever was such a thing.

                        record a little greeting in case of an untimely death on my part. Not that
                        death at any time is ever timely.

                        that's the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end. What am I tripping for?
                        Everything is going to work out exactly the way it's supposed to.<br><br>
